<p>On "election-methods-list", we discuss the nitty-gritty details of
single-winner election reform, the relative merits of different
proportional representation systems, and the technical underpinnings
of all election methods. "election-methods-list" discussions tend to
be technical in nature (or at least, very laden with jargon), with the
ultimate goal of providing recommendations and educational material to
the electoral reform movement.
</p><p>Those that want to have in-depth discussions about the
technical subtleties of election methods can use
"election-methods-list" to discuss those things without fear of
reprisal from those who aren't interested.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Code_of_Conduct">Code of
Conduct</span></h2>
<p>Please come prepared to defend the statements that you make, and
to directly answer the questions that others ask of you. This list
was set up to increase communication between people interested in
new forms of election methodology, not as a sounding board for
those who wish to drown out opposing views with prolific repetition
of statements already made. When conflicts arise, please use this
list to understand <i>fully</i> why the other side feels the way
they do by honest intellectual inquiry. And when those who feel
differently than you are trying to understand why you feel the way
you do, please answer as honestly and directly as possible.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is all common sense, but sadly not common enough
(hence the reason for this message). In summary, please ask,
answer, and be humble.</p>
