Can I create an org-mode readme?  That'd be really cool....

Happy [[https://robla.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_of_July][4th of July]] y'all!  Most of the relevant journaling about electorama.com is probably going to be found on [[https://electowiki.org/wiki/User:RobLa/Journal][robla's journal on electowiki]].
This is a checkout of the electorama.com website.  It's in a subdirectory off the home directory out on the server, too.

I fixed up the favicon in the site today
